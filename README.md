# Tellurian.Geospatial
Strongly typed object model for geospatial calculations and transformations.
All types are also serializable with the *DataContractSerializer* and *System.Text.Json*.
From release 2.3.0 this package only supports .NET 6+.

Released under MIT license 2020.
## Namespace *Tellurian.Geospatial*
Types for basic calculations of dictances etc. and building blocks for more advanced spatial algorithms.
* **Angle** representing 0 <= *degrees* < 360 and radians 0 <= *radians* < 2Π.
* **Distance** representing zero or positive distances in meters and kilometers.
* **Position** with **Latitude** and **Longitude** representing a two dimensional location on earth surface. The user must decide on which datum a position is expressed, for exampe WGS 84, ETRS 89 or similar. 
* **Speed** representing a zero or positive speed in m/s and km/h.
* **Stretch** between two **Position**s representing propertes for stretches on earth surface, ie. *distance*, *direction*, *on track distance* etc.
* **Vector** represening a **Distance** with an **Angle**.

Each of these objects has value safe initializers and useful methods for calculating distances, angles etc. 

## Namespace *Tellurian.Geospatial.Surfaces* 
Types for modelling surfaces. Added from release 2.1.0.
* **CircularSurface** representing a *ReferencePosition* with a *Radius*.
* **PolygonalSurface** representing a *ReferencePosition* sourrounded by a polygonal border.

Surfaces has a *Includes(Position)* method that tells if a *Position* lies on or within the surface's border. 
You can create your own by derive from **Surface** base class.

## Namespace *Tellurian.Geospatial.Transform*
Types and methods for transforming between cartesian and planar coordinates.
* **EarthEllipsoid** represents the form of the earth. There are a few preconfigured, see below. You can easy create other.
* **MapProjection** represents how coordinates are mapped to the earth.  There are a few preconfigured, see below. You can easy create other.
* **GridCoordinate** represents a planar coordinate.
* **GaussKrügerTransformer** uses the objects above to transform between cartesian and planar coordinates.

There are built-in *map projections* for planar coordinates:
* **MapProjections.UTMxx**, where 'xx' is any of zone 32-35 used in Europe.
* **MapProjections.Sweref99TM** and **MapProjections.RT90** used in Sweden.

There are built-in *ellipsoids*:
* **Ellipsoids.WGS84** used for most GPS-devices.
* **Ellipsoids.GRS80** used for many transformations to/from planar coordinates.
* **Ellipsoids.Hayford1910** 

## Namespace *Tellurian.Geospatial.DistanceCalculators*
The method for calculating distances between **Position**s is pluggable because applications have different requirements regarding  precision and speed of calculation. 
The following **DistanceCalculator** is included:
* **HaversineDistanceCalculator** is a fast calculation that is suitable for distances down to decimeters, suitable for tracking of movable objects. 
This is also the default **DistanceCalculator**.

You can write additional distance calculators by implementing the *IDistanceCalculator* interface and use it to calculate distances of **Stretch**es.
